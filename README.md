# 🌱 Core Spring & Spring Boot Labs

This repository contains my lab work from the **Spring Academy** courses on **Core Spring** and **Spring Boot**.  
It’s a space to explore, experiment, and learn by doing.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
Through these labs, I’m practicing and deepening my understanding of:
- ✅ **Dependency Injection** and the Spring IoC container  
- ✅ **Configuration** using Java, XML, and annotations  
- ✅ **Spring Boot auto-configuration** and starters  
- ✅ **Data access** with Spring Data JPA and JDBC  
- ✅ **REST APIs** with Spring MVC  
- ✅ **Testing** with JUnit and Spring Test  
- ✅ **Best practices** for modern Spring applications
